# Progress Log

## Completed
- Created common domain layer structure
- Implemented base domain models and value objects
- Created repository interfaces
- Implemented use cases:
  - Menu management
  - Theme management
  - Image management
  - QR code management
- Added error handling and validation
- Updated bot handlers to use new structure
- Added comprehensive test coverage:
  - Domain models
  - Domain services
  - Application use cases
  - Infrastructure handlers

## Next Steps
1. Implement infrastructure layer:
   - Database repositories
   - File storage service
   - Caching
   - Logging

2. Add application services:
   - Command processing
   - Message handling
   - State management

3. Enhance error handling:
   - Add more specific exceptions
   - Improve error messages
   - Add error recovery mechanisms

4. Add validation:
   - Input validation
   - Business rule validation
   - State validation

5. Improve bot handlers:
   - Add more user feedback
   - Improve error messages
   - Add help commands
   - Add command aliases

6. Add testing:
   - Integration tests
   - End-to-end tests
   - Performance tests
   - Load tests

## Current Status
- Domain layer is well-structured with clear separation of concerns
- All major features have implemented use cases
- Basic error handling and validation are in place
- Bot handlers are updated to use new structure
- Comprehensive test coverage for core functionality

## Known Issues
- Need to implement actual file storage
- Need to implement proper database integration
- Need to add caching
- Need to add comprehensive testing
- Need to improve error messages and user feedback
- Need to add more validation rules
- Need to improve bot command handling
- Need to add more user feedback mechanisms

## 2024-03-21: DDD Reorganization

### Completed
1. Created common domain layer structure:
   - models/
   - repositories/
   - services/
   - value_objects/

2. Created base domain models using dataclass:
   - DomainModel (base)
   - Organization
   - Menu
   - User

3. Created value objects:
   - Money (for handling currency and amounts)
   - Theme (for menu themes)

4. Created base repository interface

5. Reorganized bot service to follow DDD:
   - Created domain layer with models and services
   - Created application layer with use cases
   - Created infrastructure layer with repository implementation
   - Implemented OrganizationCreation domain model
   - Implemented OrganizationService
   - Implemented CreateOrganizationUseCase
   - Implemented MemoryOrganizationCreationRepository

6. Implemented additional use cases for bot:
   - Menu management:
     - MenuUpload domain model
     - MenuRepository interface
     - MenuService
     - ManageMenuUseCase
   - Theme management:
     - Theme domain model
     - ThemeRepository interface
     - ThemeService
     - ManageThemeUseCase

### Next Steps
1. Complete bot service reorganization:
   - Implement image management use cases
   - Implement QR code generation use cases
   - Add proper error handling
   - Add validation
   - Add logging
   - Update bot handlers to use new structure

2. Reorganize generator service to follow DDD:
   - Create domain layer
   - Move business logic to application layer
   - Implement repository interfaces
   - Update to use new domain models and value objects

3. Create additional value objects:
   - Image
   - Category
   - MenuItem

4. Implement repository interfaces for each service

5. Update service configurations to use common models

### Notes
- Using dataclass for domain models provides better immutability and validation
- Value objects are implemented as frozen dataclasses
- Need to ensure backward compatibility during migration
- Consider creating migration scripts for database changes
- Update documentation to reflect new structure
- Bot service reorganization focuses on clean separation of concerns
- Each use case is focused on a specific business capability
